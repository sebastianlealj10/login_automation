Suggestions

- The form should not be in a question, it is better to say Email, Password etc rather that What is your email?
- There is a radio button for new customers but any option is included in the login, if it is a new customer should
have the option to create an account
- Present the password options in radio buttons is not a good practice, it is enough to have a password field.
- The sign button should be aligned to right, it is more comfortable to the user
- If there is a secure sign in why it is necessary to put a password there?
- The sign in button is too long
